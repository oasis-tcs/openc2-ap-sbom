## Description

This repository provides configuration management and version control for developing the OpenC2 Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) actuator
profile. Actuator profiles identify the aspects of the OpenC2 language specification that are mandatory and/or meaningful in the context of a given
actuator. Actuator Profiles also identify specifiers and options that are unique to the actuator. This repository will focus on the use of OpenC2 to request
and retrieve SBoMs from conformant actuators using industry standard SBoM formats.
