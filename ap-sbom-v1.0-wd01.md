#### Abstract:
Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) is an emerging set of standards for identifying and listing software components, information about those components, and supply chain relationships between them. This profile defines the Actions, Targets, Specifiers and Options that are consistent with the version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification ([OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]) in the context of Software Bill of Materials retrieval.

# 1 Introduction

_The content in this section is non-normative, except where it is marked normative._

This document is the specification for
the OpenC2 actuator profile
of a device with the
capability to return a Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) when queried.

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications
that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components.
OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm
where a _Command_ is encoded by a _Producer_ (managing application)
and transferred to a _Consumer_ (managed device or virtualized function)
using a secure transfer protocol,
and the Consumer can respond with status and any requested information.

OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands
to discover the set of capabilities supported
by the managed devices.
These capabilities permit the managing application
to adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the managed device.
The capability definitions can be easily extended in a noncentralized manner,
allowing standard and non-standard capabilities to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.

Editor's Note: This following is from the intial OASIS baseline documents and should be removed prior to approval. It reamins for now as reminders for the editors.

The text in this section may all be replaced, but the following three sections (1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) are required for OASIS publications. Section 1.1 (IPR Policy) must not be changed by the TC. Section 1.2 (Terminology) may be modified to include other terminology-related information used in this specification. Section 1.3 (Normative References) should be modified to include additional references, as needed. Section 1.4 (Non-Normative References) is not required, but should be modified to include additional references, as needed.

Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named ap-sbom-v1.0-wd01.md):

pandoc -f gfm -t html ap-sbom-v1.0-wd01.md -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css --toc --toc-depth=5 -s -o ap-sbom-v1.0-wd01.html --metadata title="Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Profile for Software Bill of Materials Retrieval Version 1.0"

We are currently using pandoc 2.6 from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.6.

This also requires the presence of a .css file containing the HTML styles (like styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css).

Note this command generates a Table of Contents (TOC) in HTML which is located at the top of the HTML document, and which requires additional editing in order to be published in the expected OASIS style. This editing will be handled by OASIS staff during publication.

## 1.1 IPR Policy
This specification is provided under the [Non-Assertion](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode) Mode of the [OASIS IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established. For information on whether any patents have been disclosed that may be essential to implementing this specification, and any offers of patent licensing terms, please refer to the Intellectual Property Rights section of the TC's web page ([https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php)).

## 1.5 Some markdown usage examples

**Text.**

Note that text paragraphs in markdown should be separated by a blank line between them -

Otherwise the separate paragraphs will be joined together when the HTML is generated.
Even if the text appears to be separate lines in the markdown source.

To avoid having the usual vertical space between paragraphs,  
append two or more space characters (or space-backslash) to the end of the lines  
which will generate an HTML break tag instead of a new paragraph tag  
(as demonstrated here).

### 1.5.1 Figures and Captions

FIGURE EXAMPLE:
<note caption is best placed ABOVE figure, to allow a link to it to display image - same for table captions>

###### Figure 1 -- Title of Figure
![image-label should be meaningful](images/image_0.png) (this image is missing)

###### Figure 2 -- OpenC2 Message Exchange
![message exchange](images/image_1.png)


### 1.5.2 Tables

#### 1.5.2.1 Basic Table
**Table 1-1. Table Label**

| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Item 1 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 2 | Something |
| Item 3 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 4 | text |

#### 1.5.2.2 Table with Three Columns and Some Bold Text
text.

| Title 1 | Title 2 | title 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| something | something | something else that is a long string of text that **might** need to wrap around inside the table box and will just continue until the column divider is reached |
| something | something | something |

#### 1.5.2.3 Table with a caption which can be referenced

###### Table 1-5. See reference label construction

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **content** | Message body as specified by content_type and msg_type. |

Here is a reference to the table caption:
Please see [Table 1-5 or other meaningful label](#table-1-5-see-reference-label-construction)


### 1.5.3 Lists

Bulleted list:
* bullet item 1.
* **Bold** bullet item 2.
* bullet item 3.
* bullet item 4.

Indented or multi-level bullet list - add two spaces per level before bullet character (* or -):
* main bullet type
  * Example second bullet
    * See third level
      * fourth level

Numbered list:
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

Left-justified list without bullets or numbers:
To list multiple items without full paragraph breaks between items, add space-backslash after each item except the last.

### 1.5.4 Reference Label Construction

REFERENCES and ANCHORS
- in markdown source, format the Reference tags as level 6 headings like: `###### [RFC2119]`
###### [RFC2119]
Bradner, S., "Key words ..."

- reference text has to be on a separate line below the tag

- format cross-references (citations of the references) like: `see [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)]`  
"see [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)]"  
(note the outer square brackets in markdown will appear in the visible HTML text)

- The text in the Reference tag (following ###### ) will become an HTML anchor using the following conversion rules:  
-- punctuation marks will be dropped (including "[" )  
-- leading white spaces will be dropped  
-- upper case will be converted to lower  
-- spaces between letters will be converted to a single hyphen

- The same HTML anchor construction rules apply to cross-references and to section headings.  
-- Thus, a section heading like "## 1.3 Normative References"  
-- becomes an anchor in HTML like `<a href="#13-normative-references">`  
-- referenced in the markdown like: see [Section 1.3](#13-normative-references)  
-- (in markdown: `"see [Section 1.3](#13-normative-references"`)  
-- similar HTML anchors are also used in constructing the TOC

### 1.5.5 Code Blocks

Text to appear as an indented code block with grey background and monospace font - use three back-ticks before and after the code block).

Note the actual backticks will not appear in the HTML format. If it's necessary to display visible backticks, place a back-slash before them like: \``` .

```
{   
    "target": {
        "x_kmip_2.0": {
            {"kmip_type": "json"},
            {"operation": "RekeyKeyPair"},
            {"name": "publicWebKey11DEC2017"}
        }
    }
}
```

Text to be highlighted as code can also be surrounded by a single "backtick" character:
`code text`

## 1.6 Page Breaks
Add horizontal rule lines where page breaks are desired in the PDF - before each major section
- insert the line rules in markdown by inserting 3 or more hyphens on a line by themselves:  ---
- place these before each main section in markdown (usually "#" - which generates the HTML `<h1>` tag)

-------

# 2 Section Heading
text.

## 2.1 Level 2 Heading
text.

### 2.1.1 Level 3 Heading
text.

#### 2.1.1.1 Level 4 Heading
text.

##### 2.1.1.1.1 Level 5 Heading
This is the deepest level, because six # gets transformed into a Reference tag.


## 2.2 Next Heading
text.

# 3 Safety, Security, and Data Protection Considerations
(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists “eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle” as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.

-------

# 4 Conformance
(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).

See "Guidelines to Writing Conformance Clauses":
